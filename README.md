# Routing visualizer with Python, Folium and Leaflet.js

# Description

This project shows points, lines and polygons in a map given a JSON with coordinates

You can see how to:

- Use Folium to generate all the elements in Leaflet.js
- Load a JSON

The data on the JSON tries to represent imaginary routes. On each route you can find stops.
Everything starts on an imaginary origin point.

Here's how your project would look like:

## Build Setup

```bash
# install pipenv to create a virtual environment
$ pip install pipenv

# inside your folder, create your virtual environment with pipenv
$ pipenv shell

# install the dependencies
$ pipenv install

# generate the map
$ python map.py
```
